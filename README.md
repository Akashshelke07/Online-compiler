# Online Compiler
Creating an online compiler with React involves developing a user interface where users can write, edit, and execute code in various programming languages. Begin by setting up a new React project using `create-react-app` and install necessary dependencies like `@monaco-editor/react` for the code editor and `@chakra-ui/react` for UI components. The core component is the `CodeEditor`, built using the Monaco Editor, which provides a robust environment for writing code. Additionally, a `LanguageSelector` component enables users to choose their desired programming language. Manage the state for code snippets and language selection within React to ensure dynamic interaction. The backend, typically set up with Node.js, receives the code and language choice from the frontend, compiles, and executes the code, then returns the output. This output is displayed on the frontend, where users can see the results of their code execution, including any compilation errors or runtime outputs. This setup creates a seamless and interactive online coding experience, leveraging the power of React for responsive and dynamic user interfaces.
